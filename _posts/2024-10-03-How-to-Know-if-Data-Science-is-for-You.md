<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here are so many different careers to decide between, even just within the realm of data. It can be really hard to know what the differences are and which is the best option for you. Let me help by walking you through it all!</p>

## What options are out there? Let's talk about three:

#### Data Science
Can't quite decide if you're more into the computer programming side of things vs the analytical side of things? Well you are in luck! The field of Data Science is rather all-encompasing. Taking part in the process nearly from beginning to end, A data scientist is trained to take part in the data gathering, cleaning, organization, analysis, and production of findings. 
The goal behind Data Science, is to find ways to provide informed decision making and to help improve the operations of the industry/business. 

You can find more information of tasks and responsibilities of a Data Scientist through various sites, such as this [site](https://www.indeed.com/hire/job-description/data-scientist?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpP63BhDYARIsAOQkATbJujt1bTXlg-VSpVQhkq4dewqyCt-5mT_inCg0ditMq_IqNJn-cMUaAnBnEALw_wcB&aceid=&gclsrc=aw.ds).

#### Data Analytics
Do you love finding answers in data? Do you specifically love taking data and creating graphs? Then there is a good chance you will like a career in data analytics. 
Data Analysts use various analysis techniques to discover answers to the quesions they may have about the data. Discovering trends, tendinces, and most likely outcomes are some of the things they spend their time looking for.
Data Analysts tend to do less work on the coding side of things and more time in the producing and delivery of presentable displays of the data. A challenging factor in this field is the necessary skill of being able to explain statistical analysis in simple and common terminology as most of the time they will be reporting their findings to non-statisticaly trained individuals.

#### Data Engineering
The very important task of creating and consistantly updating/improving the infastructure has a designated field itself, known as Data Engineering. Often working with and maintaining the databases and software systems that manage and contain the data to be worked on, Data Engeneers will also take part in the preparation for and gathering of new data. A lot of the time, a business will need to gather data in various forms and from various sources. It is the Data Engineers responsibility to prepare for this.

## What is it like to hold these roles?

### Data Scientist



### Data Analyst
According to [tealhq.com](https://www.tealhq.com/work-life-balance/big-data-analyst#:~:text=Work%2DLife%20Balance%20FAQs%20for%20Big%20Data%20Analyst&text=Big%20Data%20Analysts%20generally%20work,tight%20deadlines%2C%20potentially%20extending%20hours.), the following can anticipated as being the typical work conditions.
As far as typical hours, it can be expected to maintain around your usual "full-time" numbers. This equates to around 40-50 hours a week, achnologing that this may fluctuate with various projects and work scenarios. As a Data Analyst it would not be too common, but should be recognized as possible, that you will need to put time in over weekends. Again, this mainly comes back to the overall status of your projects, due dates, emergencies, etc. So, it seems to me like as long as you stay on top of your work, you might not ever have to worry about missing that big game over the weekend! 
Now for the question I know you want the answer to: Can I work from home as a Data Analyst? Though the answer to this question is by no means an all encompasing answer, the generalized reply is that YES, often times Data Analyst are able to work from home, at least for part of the time. As you might expect, each company will be different, but don't be too surprised if this option becomes available to you.
