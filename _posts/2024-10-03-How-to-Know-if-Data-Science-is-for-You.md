<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here are so many different careers to choose from, even within the realm of data. It can be really hard to know what the differences are and which is the best option for you. Let me help walk you through it!</p>

## What options are out there? Let's talk about three:

#### Data Science
Can't quite decide if you're more into the computer programming side of things vs the analytical side of things? Well you are in luck! The field of Data Science is quite all-encompassing. Taking part in the process nearly from beginning to end, Data scientists are trained to participate in data gathering, cleaning, organization, analysis, and presenting findings. 
The goal of Data Science is to provide informed decision-making and help improve business operations. 

A common difficulty within this career field is the need for constant learning and adaptation. It can be anticipated that the way you would do things at the start of your career would be very different from how you would do them at the end of your career. For some, this may be a concern, but for others this is a welcomed challenge to continually learn and adapt with the changes in technology and the Data Science methods.

#### Data Analytics
Do you love finding answers in data? Do you specifically love taking data and creating graphs? Then there is a good chance you will like a career in data analytics. 
Data Analysts use various analysis techniques to discover answers to the quesions they may have about the data. They spend time discovering trends, tendencies, and probable outcomes.
Data Analysts tend to do less work on the coding side of things and more time in the producing and delivery of presentable displays of the data. A challenging factor in this field is the necessary skill of being able to explain statistical analysis in simple and common terminology as most of the time they will be reporting their findings to non-statistically trained individuals.

#### Data Engineering
The very important task of creating and consistently updating/improving the infastructure has a designated field itself, known as Data Engineering. Often working with and maintaining the databases and software systems that manage and contain the data to be worked on, Data Engineers will also take part in the preparation for and gathering of new data. A lot of the time, a business will need to gather data in various forms and from various sources. It is the Data Engineer's responsibility to prepare for this.

## What is it like to hold the role of a Data Scientist?
Now that you've got a general idea as to what Data Science is in comparison to two other similar career paths, lets dive deeper into what it'd look like for you to be a Data Scientist. After all, that's what you are here for, to determine if Data Science is the right choice for you! Which, I must add, would make me super glad if you decided it was!

According to [tealhq.com](https://www.tealhq.com/work-life-balance/data-scientist), the following can be anticipated as typical work conditions.

As far as typical hours, it can be expected to maintain around your usual "full-time" numbers. This equates to around 40-45 hours a week, acknowledging that this may fluctuate with various projects. As a Data Scientist, working over weekends or late nights is uncommon, but possible depending on project deadlines or emergencies. Again, this mainly comes back to the overall status of your projects, due dates, emergencies, etc. So, it seems to me like as long as you stay on top of your work, you might not ever have to worry about missing that big game over the weekend! 

Now for the question I know you want the answer to: "Can I work from home as a Data Scientist?" While not all-encompassing, the general answer is YESâ€”Data Scientists can often work from home, at least part of the time. As you might expect, each company will be different, but don't be too surprised if this option becomes available to you. 

### Salary Comparisons

| Career         | US Average Yearly Salary |

| Data Analyst   | $78,855                  |
| Data Engineer  | $128,992                 |


## Call to action
By now, I hope you have a clearer sense of whether Data Science is the right fit for you, or if another path might suit you better. Either way, I've given you a solid starting point for your research. I encourage you to keep exploring whichever option has sparked your interest and take the next steps toward your dream job!
