<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he 2008-09 football season was arguably the best in program history for the University of Utah. Going 13-0 with the final game being against a young Nick Saban Alabama team in the Sugar Bowl, was a huge step forward for the program and bolstered Head Coach Kyle Whitingham's reputation. Obviously, going undefeated tells you a lot about how well the team performed, but what more can we learn about what lead to their success? Where did they thrive statistically in comparison to their opponents? These are the questions I will be answering in this post along with showing you how I did so! </p>
