<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you have taken a look at my previous blog post entitled "Analyzing the Perfect Season", then you will find this post to be a summary of some of the more interesting findings from my analysis of the University of Utah's 2008 football season. If you have not yet checked out that post, this will be a nice sample for you and hopefully intrique you enough to go check it out as well! Along with a summary of the statistics, I will also provide you with a link to an app where you can take a look into the data yourself! </p>

### Motivation
I have always been a huge Utah football fan and have watched and supported them with every game they've played in. Having been in awe of the success they had in the 2008 season, I was interested in taking a deeper look into the data from their games to try and see what I could learn about their success. There were a lot of different data that I could've chosen to look at from the [college football API](https://collegefootballdata.com/) that I used, but I decided to look at the data from each of the offensive and defensive possesions they had during their regular season games. Was their offense the main reason why they won games? Or was it their defense? Or maybe even a combo of the two? I set out to see what I could find.

### Code Reference
There was a good amount of coding that I had to do to gather, clean and organize of this data and get it ready for some analyzing. To see this code and get an idea of the things I had to do, you are welcome to check out this [repository](https://github.com/hsanders-07/post_2_code) which also contains the complete dataset that I started out with. 

### Some of my Findings
There were various different correlations and comparisons that chose to take a look at, but here I will simply provide you with some of my favorite findings. 
One of the comparisons I wanted to take a look at was yards gained vs starting yards to go, that meaning yards until they'd get a touchdown. As I mentioned one of the main motivations I had for this project was to see if Utah was as successful on the offensive side of the ball as they were on the defensive side. So, to gain some insight on this, I created two different plots to display the relationships between these two variables, one being all of the Utes' offensive drives and the other being all of the defensive possessions for the Utes'.
